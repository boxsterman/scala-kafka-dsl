# Feedback of the presentation at the ZÃ¼rich Scala Meetup 24.9.2019 

- Current set of slides took about 70 minutes to present, which was too long
    - without live coding / live execution!
    - spend less time on the intro part, in particular be brief on the definition slide
    - Omit the Avro part (this is a big topic in itself)
